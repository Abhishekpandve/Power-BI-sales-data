## Problem Statement

In this project, I have developed an interactive Power BI Sales Dashboard on Global super store sales data and extract some insights from the data. Power query was used to clean and transform the data, and DAX was utilized to create the calculated measures and calculated column in order to construct the dashboard. The process of ETL was completed in accordance with the requirements.
